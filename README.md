My motivation was to refactor code and create a codebase that follows accessibility standards.

I build this this project to practice refactoring a code and to learn how to create quality comments.

This solves a problem for developers who work on large projects, restructuring existing code helps to enhance organisation and keep code clean. Writing quality comments helps to find necessary blocks of code more effectively, for example, when a new developer starts to work on an existing project. 

I learned how to refactor someone elses code and how to leave quality comments. 

My project stand out because it is properly refactored and contains quality comments.
